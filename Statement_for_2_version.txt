In the process of answering the questions, I always write a problem solving process in the draft book first, and then copy it to another answer sheet, which is to ensure that the paper is clean and easy to read. 

However, on the last question, After I wrote down the process of the question on the draft paper, it was very close to the end of the exam, so my writing in the last question was very confusing. Especially on the third question, I changed the expression of some constants during the copying process, but some of them were not changed.

That's why I uploaded the second version. To make sure that the notation for the last problem is consistent.}
