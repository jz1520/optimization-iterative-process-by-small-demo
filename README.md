# optimization-iterative-process-by-small-demo
The significance of this project: Personally, even though I have learned a lot about deep learning before and have done some projects on neural network, once I do not use it for a long time, I will soon forget my knowledge and code skills. The purpose of this project is to help myself consolidate the deep learning knowledge and also help beginners of deep learning to know how to optimize a project from simple to complex. The project will start with the simplest single neural network and gradually become more complex. And constantly trial and error, trying different optimization schemes. There's a lot of personal analysis that I want you to read for yourself. Friends who like it, or find it useful, can help me star it, thank you.
